This is basically just a project for me to play around with tkinter and making GUIs from pure code.

To play, simply run minesweeper.py through a Python interpreter, select your difficulty and begin.

If you aren't sure how to play Minesweeper, I recommend looking around on Google.

NOTE: None of the fancy moves are incorperated because I don't know how they work. In this version, you left-click to sweep a tile and right-click to flag a tile. That's it.
